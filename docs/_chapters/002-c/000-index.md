C programming offers power and flexibility, but its manual memory management and lack of built-in checks leave it vulnerable. Common pitfalls include memory errors (like use-after-free and dangling pointers), buffer overflows from exceeding array boundaries, integer arithmetic issues, and format string attacks from untrusted input. Mitigating these vulnerabilities requires careful memory management, bounds checking, using safer functions, validating user input, employing memory debugging tools, and adhering to secure coding practices.
