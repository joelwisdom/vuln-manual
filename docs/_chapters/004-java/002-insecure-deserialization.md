## Definition
Insecure deserialization is a vulnerability where untrusted data is deserialized without proper validation, leading to potential security risks. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, tamper with objects, or launch denial-of-service attacks.
### Risks of Insecure Deserialization:
Insecure deserialization can result in code execution, data tampering, or denial-of-service attacks, depending on how attackers manipulate the deserialized data.


## Example
```
import java.io.*;
public class InsecureDeserializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        // Vulnerable deserialization:
        byte[] serializedData = /* Read from untrusted source */;
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(serializedData));
        Object obj = in.readObject();
        // Attacker-controlled code could now be executed
        ((MyClass) obj).doSomething();
    }
}

class MyClass implements Serializable {
    public void doSomething() {
        // Malicious code could be injected here
        System.out.println("Attacker-controlled code executed!");
    }
}
```

## Explanation
Attackers manipulate serialized objects to include malicious code or tamper with object properties. When the application deserializes these objects, the malicious code is executed, leading to unauthorized actions or system compromise.

## Mitigation Techniques
- Implement Integrity Checks: Apply digital signatures or checksums to serialized objects to verify their integrity during deserialization.
- Use Safe Deserialization Practices: Avoid deserializing untrusted data from unreliable sources and employ safe deserialization libraries or mechanisms.
- Implement Whitelisting: Maintain a whitelist of permitted classes for deserialization and reject any serialized objects not belonging to the whitelist.
